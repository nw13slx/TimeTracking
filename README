This is a little bash script that I wrote to track my time spent on each project and some work log in markdown file format. I personally prefer plain text storage format. So later I can use simple bash to do pattern recognition analysis

You can change the "logpath" to your log folder. The logfile is store as text file in year/month/day format. You can easily change it at the "logdir" and "logfile" definition line.

This is a little bash script that I wrote to track my time spent on each project and some work log in markdown file format. I personally prefer plain text storage format. So later I can use simple bash to do pattern recognition analysis

Setting:
1. "logpath" You can change the "logpath" to your log folder. The logfile is store as text file in year/month/day format. You can easily change it at the "logdir" and "logfile" definition line.
2. create a file "activities" in your worklog directory. So the script has a list of activities to choose from

To-do list
1. automatically figure out the gap between each activity and fill out the gap with to-be-recorded status
2. at the end of the day, compile the txt file with pandoc
3. in the record one, automatically recognize empty line and newline command. 
4. post-analysis code including hashtag recognition, time statistics
